Welcome to the Weather App project, your go-to tool for checking the current weather in any city! 🚀

## Overview 📝

- The Weather App is a simple web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It leverages the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data for a specified city. Key functionalities include searching for weather information by city name and displaying essential weather details, such as temperature, minimum temperature, and maximum temperature.
- API was acquired from https://rapidapi.com

## Features ✨

- **Search by City:** Enter the name of a city to retrieve up-to-date weather information.
- **Real-time Data:** Get instant updates on the current weather conditions.
- **Responsive Design:** The app's layout is designed to be visually appealing and user-friendly.

## Tech Stack 💻

- HTML
- CSS (Bootstrap 4.3.1)
- JavaScript

## How to Use 🌐

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Enter the desired city in the input field.
